# Manager app

This is the manager app.
At the first page you can log in or make a new account. 
If that is succesfull, you will see a page with all available employees that you have. 
You can choose to add people. 
If you do this you must give up a name, phone number and the day of the shift.
You can also click on an employee in the list and here you can change something, text the schedule to the employee or fire him/her.
